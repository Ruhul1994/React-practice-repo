Great question, Ruhul! Let’s break it down in a simple way:

---

### 🔹 Basic Idea:

`encodeURIComponent()` is a JavaScript function that **makes a string safe to use inside a URL**.

---

### 🔹 Why we need it:

When you build a URL like:

```jsx
<Link to={`/user/${u.Id}/${u.name}`}>
```

If `u.name` is something like:  
**`John Doe & Sons`**

Then the link will become:

```
/user/123/John Doe & Sons
```

That’s **not safe** in a URL. Spaces, `&`, `?`, `/`, etc., can break the URL or change its meaning.

---

### 🔹 What `encodeURIComponent()` does:

It turns unsafe characters into **safe code** for URLs.

```js
encodeURIComponent("John Doe & Sons")
```

➡️ becomes

```
"John%20Doe%20%26%20Sons"
```

So now your URL becomes:

```
/user/123/John%20Doe%20%26%20Sons
```

✅ This is safe and will not break your route.

---

### 🔹 Real Example:

```jsx
const u = { Id: 123, name: "John Doe & Sons" };

<Link to={`/user/${u.Id}/${encodeURIComponent(u.name)}`}>
  Visit Profile
</Link>
```

---

### 🔹 Decode it (if needed):

If you want to get the original name back from the URL, you can use:

```js
decodeURIComponent(encodedName)
```

---

### ✅ Summary:

|Function|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`encodeURIComponent()`|Make text safe to put in a URL|
|`decodeURIComponent()`|Convert it back to the original text|

Would you like me to show how to decode it in React Route Params too?
