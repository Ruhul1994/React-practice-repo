In **React Router v6+ (including React 19)**, a **route prefix** is often managed using **nested routes** or a **layout route** with a base path. You use **route prefixes** when you want several routes to share a common base path — for example, for all admin pages, blog posts, or user profiles.

---

## ✅ When to Use Route Prefixes

Use **route prefixes** when:

- You have grouped pages (e.g., `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/settings`).
    
- You want to apply a layout (like a sidebar or navbar) to all routes under a prefix.
    
- You want cleaner and more maintainable routing structure.

## ✅ Example: `/dashboard` as Route Prefix

We will use `/dashboard` as the route prefix.

### 🗂️ Folder Structure

```
src/
├── App.jsx
├── main.jsx
└── pages/
    ├── DashboardLayout.jsx
    ├── DashboardHome.jsx
    ├── DashboardSettings.jsx
    └── Home.jsx
```

---

### 🔧 Step 1: `main.jsx` (React Router Setup)

```jsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
import App from "./App";

createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

---

### 🔧 Step 2: `App.jsx` – Define Routes with Prefix `/dashboard`

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import DashboardLayout from "./pages/DashboardLayout";
import DashboardHome from "./pages/DashboardHome";
import DashboardSettings from "./pages/DashboardSettings";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      
      {/* Prefix route: /dashboard */}
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardLayout />}>
        <Route index element={<DashboardHome />} /> {/* /dashboard */}
        <Route path="settings" element={<DashboardSettings />} /> {/* /dashboard/settings */}
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
};

export default App;
```

---

### 🔧 Step 3: `DashboardLayout.jsx` – Layout with `<Outlet />`

```jsx
import { Outlet, Link } from "react-router-dom";

const DashboardLayout = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Dashboard Layout</h2>
      <nav>
        <Link to="">Home</Link> | <Link to="settings">Settings</Link>
      </nav>
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

export default DashboardLayout;
```

---

### 🔧 Step 4: Dashboard Pages

#### `DashboardHome.jsx`

```jsx
const DashboardHome = () => <h3>Dashboard Home</h3>;
export default DashboardHome;
```

#### `DashboardSettings.jsx`

```jsx
const DashboardSettings = () => <h3>Dashboard Settings</h3>;
export default DashboardSettings;
```

---

### 🔧 Step 5: Home Page

#### `Home.jsx`

```jsx
const Home = () => <h1>Welcome to Home Page</h1>;
export default Home;
```

---

## ✅ Resulting Routes

|URL|Component Rendered|
|---|---|
|`/`|`Home`|
|`/dashboard`|`DashboardLayout + DashboardHome`|
|`/dashboard/settings`|`DashboardLayout + DashboardSettings`|

---

## ✅ Summary

**Route Prefix** is useful to group routes like:

- `/admin/*`
    
- `/user/*`
    
- `/products/*`
    

Use a **layout route with `<Outlet />`** to share UI and path under a common prefix.

If you'd like to see a real project example (e.g., `/blog`, `/shop`, `/admin`), I can create one for you — just tell me your use case.
