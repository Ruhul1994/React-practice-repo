In a React project, the number of **hooks** you need for a job-ready project or viva (face-to-face technical interview) depends on what you're building and the depth of questions expected. But here’s a smart breakdown for **must-know React hooks**:

---

### ✅ **Core Hooks (You MUST know – 100% expected)**

| Hook          | Use case                                     | Common in                         |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `useState`    | Managing local component state               | Work + Viva                       |
| `useEffect`   | Side effects (fetching data, timers, etc.)   | Work + Viva                       |
| `useRef`      | Accessing DOM, storing values across renders | Work + Viva                       |
| `useContext`  | Global state / theming / language switching  | Work + Viva                       |
| `useCallback` | Optimizing child components                  | Viva (for optimization questions) |
| `useMemo`     | Memoizing values                             | Viva                              |
| `useReducer`  | Managing complex state (like Redux lite)     | Work (larger apps)                |

### ✅ **Bonus (Advanced or Job-Level Hooks – Good to know)**

|Hook|Use case|Common in|
|---|---|---|
|`useLayoutEffect`|Sync layout after DOM updates|Advanced Work|
|`useImperativeHandle`|Customizing `ref` behavior for child components|Viva|
|`useId`|For unique IDs in SSR-safe way|Work (accessibility/forms)|
|`useTransition`|For concurrent rendering transitions|Work (React 18+)|
|`useDeferredValue`|Low-priority rendering|Work (React 18+)|

### 🔧 **Custom Hooks**

- **What**: Functions starting with `use`, like `useAuth()`, `useForm()`, etc.
    
- **Why**: Helps reuse logic cleanly.
    
- **Expected in Viva**: Yes – they often ask _“How to build a custom hook?”_
    

---

### 🎯 **So how many hooks to learn?**

- **Minimum for job/viva**:  
    ✅ `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`  
    ✅ + `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useReducer`
    
- **Total: 7 essential hooks** + 1 custom hook example.

### 💡 Pro Tip for Viva:

You’ll often be asked:

- What’s the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?
    
- Why use `useMemo` or `useCallback`?
    
- How would you build a `useFetch` custom hook?
