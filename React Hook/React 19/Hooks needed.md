In a React project, the number of **hooks** you need for a job-ready project or viva (face-to-face technical interview) depends on what you're building and the depth of questions expected. But here’s a smart breakdown for **must-know React hooks**:

---

### ✅ **Core Hooks (You MUST know – 100% expected)**

|Hook|Use case|Common in|
|---|---|---|
|`useState`|Managing local component state|Work + Viva|
|`useEffect`|Side effects (fetching data, timers, etc.)|Work + Viva|
|`useRef`|Accessing DOM, storing values across renders|Work + Viva|
|`useContext`|Global state / theming / language switching|Work + Viva|
|`useCallback`|Optimizing child components|Viva (for optimization questions)|
|`useMemo`|Memoizing values|Viva|
|`useReducer`|Managing complex state (like Redux lite)|Work (larger apps)|

---

### ✅ **Bonus (Advanced or Job-Level Hooks – Good to know)**

|Hook|Use case|Common in|
|---|---|---|
|`useLayoutEffect`|Sync layout after DOM updates|Advanced Work|
|`useImperativeHandle`|Customizing `ref` behavior for child components|Viva|
|`useId`|For unique IDs in SSR-safe way|Work (accessibility/forms)|
|`useTransition`|For concurrent rendering transitions|Work (React 18+)|
|`useDeferredValue`|Low-priority rendering|Work (React 18+)|

### 🔧 **Custom Hooks**

- **What**: Functions starting with `use`, like `useAuth()`, `useForm()`, etc.
    
- **Why**: Helps reuse logic cleanly.
    
- **Expected in Viva**: Yes – they often ask _“How to build a custom hook?”_
    

---

### 🎯 **So how many hooks to learn?**

- **Minimum for job/viva**:  
    ✅ `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useContext`  
    ✅ + `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useReducer`
    
- **Total: 7 essential hooks** + 1 custom hook example.

### 💡 Pro Tip for Viva:

You’ll often be asked:

- What’s the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?
    
- Why use `useMemo` or `useCallback`?
    
- How would you build a `useFetch` custom hook?
